Welcome to the scona GitHub repository!:sparkles: <img align="right" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwwL4kj5z1Id6uI/giphy.gif">

## Get Started

To install scona as a python package with pip
```
pip install git+https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona.git@dev
```

Check out our [tutorial](tutorials/tutorial.ipynb) for examples of basic functionality.




## What are we doing?
scona is a toolkit to analyse structural covariance brain networks using python.  

scona takes regional cortical thickness data obtained from structural MRI and generates a matrix of correlations between regions over a cohort of subjects. The correlation matrix is used alongside the [networkx package](https://networkx.github.io/) to generate a variety of networks and network measures.

The scona codebase was first developed by Dr Kirstie Whitaker for the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network publication "Adolescence is associated with genomically patterned consolidation of the hubs of the human brain connectome" published in PNAS in 2016 [(Whitaker*, Vertes* et al, 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1601745113)). This project is to take the existing codebase (accessible at https://github.com/KirstieJane/NSPN_WhitakerVertes_PNAS2016) and turn it into a documented, tested python package that is easy to use and re-use.


## Want to get involved?
scona is openly developed and welcomes contributers.

If you're thinking about contributing (:green_heart: you are loved), our [roadmap](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona/issues/12) and our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/scona/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are a good place to start. You don't need advanced skills or knowledge to help out. Newbies to Python, neuroscience, git and GitHub are all welcome.
